            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>N Prison inmates are standing in a circle waiting to be executed. They are tagged based on their position 1,2,3... so on. Consequently, the Nth inmate stands next to inmate 1. The executioner decides to pardon one of these inmates. His technique for carrying out the execution is simple: he alternately pardons/kills inmates in a cyclic fashion. He pardons the 1st inmate, executes the 2nd, then pardons the 3rd inmate, executes the 4th. If by chance he pardons the Nth inmate he executes the 1st, since they are in a circle. The executioner continues like this until there is only one inmate left. Your job is to predict this lucky prisoner who survives.</p>

                <h2>Explanation</h2>
                <p>Two scenarios were tested. In the first scenario 4 inmates were rounded up. The executioner pardons 1, kills 2, pardons 3, kills 4 the cycles back, since he had killed 4, he pardons 1, kills 3. Since only one prisoner remains, 1 is the lucky prisoner.</p>
                <p>In the second scenario 1000 inmates were rounded up. 977 is the lucky prisoner.</p>
                <p>Submissions: 33</p>
